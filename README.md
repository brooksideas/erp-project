# Expose Response Prevent App

ERP, or Exposure and Response Prevention therapy,
is the gold-standard for OCD treatment. In ERP, you voluntarily expose yourself to the source of your fear over and over and over again, without acting out any compulsions to neutralize or stop the fear. By repeatedly facing something youâ€™re afraid of, you force your brain to recognize how irrational it is.

This App Attempts to help out this process. Check it out!
